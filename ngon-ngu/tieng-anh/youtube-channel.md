- [Deep Look](https://www.youtube.com/@KQEDDeepLook) Such awesome videos about all sorts of natural life. [The one on decorator crabs is my favorite](https://youtu.be/OwQcv7TyX04)
- [SciShow](https://youtu.be/BGACvb3Mm60)
- [PBS Space Time](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsPUh22kYmNCGaVGuGfKfJl-6RdHiCjo1)
- [Veritasium](https://youtu.be/HeQX2HjkcNo), 
- [Tom Scott](https://youtu.be/2vd8Wfk9im0)
- [Historia Civilis](https://youtu.be/fD-R35DSSZY)
- [Exurb1a](https://youtube.com/c/Exurb1a) makes videos that delve into deep topics like the nature of reality, with a very humorous twist. And some are just really funny without the deep thoughts. Either way, sounds like you'll enjoy it, especially since you're looking for content to watch while you're under the influence of certain substances, since you'll either have your mind blown while giggling, or just be giggling ;)
- [Pursuit of Wonder](https://youtube.com/c/PursuitofWonder) has videos that range from short stories to video essays that explore philosophy and the unknowns in life, like consciousness theory and existentialism. The stories this guy writes himself are mind blowing and entertaining, and the videos about theories and philosophy are just as good!
- [Spirit Science](https://youtube.com/c/SpiritverseOfficial) is a true blend of 50% science and 50% spirituality. This channel may not be for everyone, as it is the most "woo woo" one on this list, but it is fascinating and has a huge catalogue of content. 
- [Instructions for a happy life](https://youtu.be/A4pR--qJTdU) is a video I come back regularly to after watching it for the first time 5 years ago when it came out

I hope it'll help people find those channels on YT, as many have little visibility (and deserve far more). A few painters and a lot of builders. (With an overview of their stuff and style for each, to help assess their "flavor".)\
And I hope you'll share yours too. The more the merrier.

- [Bard's Craft](https://www.youtube.com/c/BardsCraft/videos) : specialist of fantasy terrains and (big) miniatures, all with simple materials and basic equipment (literal kitchen knife). Good stuff if you're just starting; and a good motivator too: proves you can make epic stuff with the simplest stuff. <>
- [Black Magic Craft](https://www.youtube.com/c/BlackMagicCraftOfficial/videos) : lots of videos, mostly fantasy with a bit of scifi. Does sophisticated builds with (mostly) salvaged stuff. As his own visual style, you may like it or not. <>
- **Dark Matter Workshop** : simple techniques but a good vision. Mostly scifi stuff, which he does pretty well. <https://www.youtube.com/user/DarkMatterWorkshop/videos>
- **Devs & Dice** : LOTS of painting, and you may not like his "flashy colors" style, but he does a variety of minis with great detail. Makes some terrain from time to time. <https://www.youtube.com/c/DevsDice/videos>
- **DIY Projects Crafts** : on the advanced level side of the craft. Superb fantasy stuff. <https://www.youtube.com/c/DIYProjectsCrafts/videos>
- **Duncan Rhodes Painting Academy** : for Warhammer fans the name will suffice. For the others too : great painting guides, with colors from Citadel but also other companies. Very good stuff. <https://www.youtube.com/c/DuncanRhodesPaintingAcademy/videos>
- **Eric's Hobby Workshop** : a great builder with an eye for transforming cheap plastic crap into unsuspected beauty. <https://www.youtube.com/c/EricsHobbyWorkshop/videos>
- **Hall of Craft** : easy terrain building, with some pretty nice ideas. <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIVr3XreXy451E1iBk5Z3rQ/videos>
- **High Eye Workshop** : the MASTER in fake water and flocking, every terrain he makes is a true masterpiece. Videos can be a bit repetitive as he's almost only interested in those two aspects of terrain building, but if you want to get good in those, he's the guy you have to follow. <https://www.youtube.com/c/HighEyeWorkshop/videos>
- **Iron Gryphon Studio** : incredible creativity in terrain making (mostly fantasy dungeon stuff). Uses all matters of techniques and materials. <https://www.youtube.com/user/Alansblogs/videos>
- **Kitbosh** : a miniature kitbash channel (in the name) with bits and minis of various companies. No terrain but he makes interesting creations who may help in the inspiration departement. <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz_GfvTNbg1vsLFqN6yHvXQ/videos>
- **Knar Makes** : a newborn channel specialized in futuristic terrain. <https://www.youtube.com/c/KnarbMakes/videos>

**Max DM Crafting** : complex big builds AND lots of detailed decorations. Has a weird video organization still, may annoy some... <https://www.youtube.com/c/MaxDMCrafting/videos>

**Nates Miniatures** : very recent channel. Not bad. <https://www.youtube.com/c/NatesMiniatures/videos>

**Paepercuts** : specialist of jungle/swamp terrain. Great care for detail. <https://www.youtube.com/c/Paepercuts/videos>

**Pete The Wargamer** : lots and lots and lots of miniature painting and kitbashing. A well of inspiration (terrain or not). <https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWarGamerChannel/videos>

**Platypus Scotman** : as much scifi than fantasy, with great care for details. Some pretty original concepts too. <https://www.youtube.com/c/PlatypusScotsman/videos>

**Real Terrain Hobbies** : terrain specialist, and a master of his craft. Immense builds and excellence in creating the most realistic details. <https://www.youtube.com/c/RealTerrainHobbies/videos>

**RP Archive** : aka lord of modular terrain for rpg games. Everything about magnetizing you'll find here. And if you don't care about that, you'll find an abundance of little things to make to add incredible detail to your terrains. Every video is a treasure trove. <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0l_deKneitQOvD9dNPktMg/videos>

**RuneBrush** : ...just getting started, but it's a good start. <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp-hMBrzE-rU48QcS1HamLA/videos>

**Scatter Craft** : some nice ideas for big builds. <https://www.youtube.com/c/ScatterCraft/videos>\
**Scratch Bashing** : the pro of turning the most worthless crap into great terrain or minis, and he does it in style. <https://www.youtube.com/c/ScratchBashing/videos>

**Stellarian Games** : maybe not the best when it comes to good looking terrain but he's rich in original ideas. If no one though about it, you bet he did. <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUlPoboXVioTpJ6_fkkoWmw/videos>

**Tabletop WitchCRAFT** : a very creative builder of fantasy terrain and dungeon. You may or may not like his visual style. <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzcHl6KKB-zh7lk05FCWd0w/videos>

**Terrain Made Easy** : all in the name. Very good for novice builders who still want to make good looking stuff. <https://www.youtube.com/c/TerrainMadeEasy/videos>

**TheDMsCraft** : a TON of videos. You may die before you'll reach the bottom of his video list. Does mostly little decoration pieces for fantasy (and a few scifi) dungeons and all in pretty easy ways to master. And with that many videos, he covers almost any part of the hobby you can think of. Excellent channel if you're a beginner. <https://www.youtube.com/c/theDMsCraft/videos>

- [TheGameSmith](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheGameSmithsTable/videos) : the pro of dollar store recycling. Pretty easy builds and extremely low visibility (YT search tool itself may fail at finding him) but he has some out of the box ideas that make it totally worth it to follow. <>

- [Wyloch's Armory](https://www.youtube.com/c/WylochsCraftingVids/videos) : scifi and fantasy stuff in same proportion. Originality and many builds, and nothing too hard to make. <>
