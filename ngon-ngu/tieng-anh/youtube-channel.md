### Essayist
- [Exurb1a](https://youtube.com/c/Exurb1a) makes videos that delve into deep topics like the nature of reality, with a very humorous twist. And some are just really funny without the deep thoughts. Either way, sounds like you'll enjoy it, especially since you're looking for content to watch while you're under the influence of certain substances, since you'll either have your mind blown while giggling, or just be giggling ;)
